# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

This notebook demonstrates the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction, matrix reconstruction, and data compression.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To explore how SVD decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components and how these can be used for approximations and low-rank representations.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

- Matrix factorization: \( A = U \Sigma V^T \)
- Energy retention vs. rank
- Eckartâ€“Youngâ€“Mirsky theorem for best low-rank approximation
- Data reconstruction from partial SVD
- Application to image and signal compression

## ðŸ”¬ Experiment Highlights

- Heatmaps of singular value decay
- Rank-k approximations and error analysis
- Frobenius norm comparisons
- Visual proof of energy conservation in SVD

## ðŸ“Ž Requirements

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`

## ðŸ’¡ Educational Insight

This experiment provides a practical introduction to dimensionality reduction using SVD, one of the core techniques in data science and signal processing.
