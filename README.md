# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Exploration: Theory, Implementation, and Applications

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a cornerstone of linear algebra with vast applications in data science, signal processing, and machine learning. I independently implemented SVD to investigate its power in low-rank approximation and dimensionality reduction, demonstrating both theoretical and practical aspects.

## Mathematical Framework
For any \(m \times n\) matrix \(A\), SVD expresses it as:
\[
A = U \Sigma V^T,
\]
where:
- \(U\) is an \(m \times m\) orthogonal matrix,
- \(\Sigma\) is an \(m \times n\) diagonal matrix with non-negative singular values,
- \(V\) is an \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrix.

The energy contained in \(A\) is concentrated in the top \(k\) singular values, which can be used to form a low-rank approximation:
\[
A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T.
\]
I studied the trade-off between compression and reconstruction fidelity by measuring the Frobenius norm of the error \( \|A - A_k\|_F \).

## Implementation & Experimentation
- **Implementation:** Using NumPy, I computed the SVD and verified the orthogonality of \(U\) and \(V\).
- **Visualization:** I compared the original matrix with its low-rank approximations, illustrating how a few singular values capture most of the important structure.
- **Analysis:** By varying \(k\), I quantified the reconstruction error, demonstrating the practical utility of SVD in data compression and noise reduction.

## Usage
- **Prerequisites:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- **Run the Notebook:** Open `Singular_Value_Decomposition.ipynb` and execute the cells.
- **Customization:** Modify \(k\) to explore different low-rank approximations and observe their impact on reconstruction quality.
